The Mists of RioV Minecraft Mod

This is a fork of the original TMOR mod, created by sheenrox. Although it says it is a fork of rich1051414's repository, it is a fork of sheenrox's original repo, which has been deleted. GitHub is buggy, and now the oldest version of the repo (rich's copy) acts like the original one.

Sheen deleting it was his way of discounting the mod. I don't plan to delete this, though. If Sheen forces me to, I might, but there's other forks (although they are much more outdated) and there's no way I'll delete my local copy. I don't have any plans to continue it. TMOR was a popular mod at one point, and MC historeans (like me) may want to look at it, and maybe Sheen himself.

This fork was created before the TMOR-TMOR2 merge, since Sheen never pushed that.
